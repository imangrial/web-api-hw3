Question:
Basic Authorization is easily handled in the main flow, without the need for an
additional proxy. Give one reason (there are many) OAuth tokens should not be
granted in the main flow, assuming the user has sent in the correct credentials.
_______________________________________________________________________________

Answer:

    You would want to use OAuth tokens in a seperate proxy for security reasons.
    When you have all of your security integrated with the main flow with the proxy
    you are at risk of having the sensitive data presented to the open world. If there
    is a breach of your proxy, then the OAuth information is readily available to the
    hackers that breached.

    Also when performing updates to your OAuth policies, it can be changed without even touching
    your main proxy. Thus only a small and segregated segment of your code (the OAuth resource)
    will have to be manipulated leaving the business logic intact.
