# web-api-hw3

NOTE: THIS USES POSTMAN TESTS!!!

Tests:
    Using postman I made the tests. Thus to use these tests, you will have to import the collections
    failure-attempts.json and successful-attempts.json for success requests and fail requests respectively.

    I have made sure to request the oauth token before submitting and not requesting another token afterwards
    so the test for the successful oauth token succeeeds. However the token may expire by then. Please run the
    request "Get Oauth Token" to obtain a new Oauth token for the other request "Test Oauth Token"

    You will need to replace the content of the "Authorization" header after "Bearer" with the newly supplied
    Oauth Token.

Endpoints:
    Although the URL to the endpoints is contained within the test suites I may as well give them here:
        Main Endpoint:
            https://onibakuman-test.apigee.net/hw3/

        Resources:
            https://onibakuman-test.apigee.net/oauth/
            https://onibakuman-test.apigee.net/basic/
